# Assorted-Projects
Repository for assorted small projects I'd like feedback on.

## Current contents:

* `online-bootstrap.py`: First attempt at implementing a poisson bootstrap to get uncertainty in mean and variance estimates when working with large data sets. Currently working but considerably slower than I'd like.
* `GP-examples.R`: Will eventually be some examples of applications of Gaussian Processes. At the moment, only has the data-generation part of the first example.
