# Assorted-Projects
Repository for assorted small projects I've done with various data analysis tools.

## Current contents:

* `Poisson-Bootstrap`: First attempt at implementing a poisson bootstrap to get uncertainty in mean and variance estimates when working with large data sets. Currently working but considerably slower than I'd like.
* `GP-examples.R`: Will eventually be some examples of applications of Gaussian Processes. At the moment, only has the data-generation part of the first example.
* `SlideRule-DS-Intensive`: Some exercises from SlideRule/SpringBoard's data science curriculum done to gain more familiarity with Python data tools.
